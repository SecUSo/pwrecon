# pwrecon

To prepare the development environment you first have to install QT.
After the installation has finished you can just load the pwRecon.pro file.
Now you can compile it. Note that there might be some errors because the tools are not available yet. To fix that you have to copy the "tools" folder in the (by QT) automatically generated directory which holds the executable. 

To be able to modify nbvcxz maven and java are needed. You should be able to compile it after installing both.
